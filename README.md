## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine the presence of heart disease in patients using various health metrics. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building using Logistic Regression, model evaluation, and saving the trained model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 instances with 14 attributes. The attributes include various health metrics such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, rest electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and thalassemia.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and pip installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-predictive-analytics.git
    cd healthcare-predictive-analytics
    ```

2. Open the `Healthcare_Predictive_Analytics.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Execute each cell in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, build and evaluate the model, and save the trained model.

## Project Structure
```

```

- `data/heart_disease.csv`: Contains the dataset.
- `Healthcare_Predictive_Analytics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all the steps to build and evaluate the model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `heart_disease_model.joblib`: Saved model file.

## Model Building Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, ensure the target variable is binary, and standardize the features.
3. **Model Building**: Build a Logistic Regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using classification report and AUC-ROC score.
5. **Save the Model**: Save the trained model using joblib.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set. The AUC-ROC score was 0.98, indicating excellent model performance.
